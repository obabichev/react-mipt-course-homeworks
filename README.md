+ request ```/``` is empty (now are available:
    + ```/boards``` 
    + ```/{board's key}```

+ this script:
```js
<Route path="/TB1" component={() => Tasks(data1)}/>
<Route path="/TB2" component={() => Tasks(data2)}/>
<Route path="/TB3" component={() => Tasks(data3)}/>
<Route path="/CTS" component={() => Tasks(data4)}/>
``` (I use 4 urls instead of single one, because component choosing depends on json(not board's key), but, of cource, I cat write converter (board's key => json)
